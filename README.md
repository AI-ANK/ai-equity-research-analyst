# AI Equity Research Analyst with LlamaIndex

Welcome to the AI Equity Research Analyst project! This application showcases the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating equity research reports.

## Overview

This Streamlit app demonstrates the use of LLMs, specifically using the Google PaLM API, to analyze and extract data from 10-K filings of renowned NYSE listed companies. The LlamaIndex orchestration framework, along with its SubQuestionQuery Engine, breaks down complex prompts into sub-questions, retrieves answers, and assembles the final equity research report.

### Demo Features:
* Select from 7 renowned NYSE listed companies.
* App reads, analyzes the latest 10-K filings, and extracts data based on complex prompts.
* LlamaIndex's SubQuestionQuery Engine decomposes complex prompts into sub-questions, fetches answers, and assembles the final report.

### Potential Enhancements:
* API-driven financial data access.
* Dedicated Python REPL for accurate calculations.
