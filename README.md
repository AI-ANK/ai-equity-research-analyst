# AI Equity Research Analyst with LlamaIndex

Welcome to the AI Equity Research Analyst demo project! This application showcases the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating equity research reports.

## Overview

This Streamlit app demonstrates the use of LLMs, specifically using the Google PaLM API, to analyze and extract data from 10-K filings of renowned NYSE listed companies. The LlamaIndex orchestration framework, along with its SubQuestionQuery Engine, breaks down complex prompts into sub-questions, retrieves answers, and assembles the final equity research report.

### Demo Features:
* Select from 7 renowned NYSE listed companies.
* App reads, analyzes the latest 10-K filings, and extracts data based on complex prompts.
* LlamaIndex's SubQuestionQuery Engine decomposes complex prompts into sub-questions, fetches answers, and assembles the final report.

### Potential Enhancements:
* API-driven financial data access.
* Dedicated Python REPL for accurate calculations.

### Building Vector Index from Scratch

If you wish to build the vector index from scratch instead of using the pre-generated vector index, you can follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have loaded the required files in the `load_data` function.
2. Uncomment the code snippet in `app.py` related to building the vector index.
3. Run the `app.py` script.

```python
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(tenk_company, service_context=service_context, use_async=True, storage_context = storage_context)
index.set_index_id("index_"+company)
index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir="storage")
```

Note: Building the vector index from scratch might take a considerable amount of time depending on the size of your data.
